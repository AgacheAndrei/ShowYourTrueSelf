## Welcome!
Our project takes on the challenge of fake videos that could potentially harm the world, especially attempting to **deceive security systems**, like the ones used in the finance sector.

### Real World Scenarios
Especially when it comes to tricking important security systems used in various sectors such as **finance**, **healthcare**, **education**, and **public safety** where fake information can do a **lot of damage**. We're on a mission to safeguard against these dangers, ensuring a more secure and authentic digital landscape for **everyone**.

### How to run the demo
The first option is to have the target folder, the PythonRunner folder and the bat file downloaded via drive data using this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XGX_PAh24mzB_Uj4VdNO3wxTephhU6mL?usp=drive_link or just get them from the project. Just double click on the bat file and the app will start at http://localhost:8080/ 


### Tech Stack
#### AI Backend:
- **Baseline Technologies**
  - Leveraging the power of Python, our tech stack establishes a robust foundation for seamless integration and efficient code implementation.
- **Deep Learning Framework:**
  - TensorFlow, a great deep learning framework, powers our AI backend, enabling powerful neural network architectures for video analysis, such as detecting unexpected facial movements.
- **Computer Vision Expertise:**
  - Using OpenCV2, our system can understand self-recorded videos through advanced image processing techniques.
- **Advanced Filtering Techniques:**
  - The implementation of Laplacian filtering enhances our AI's ability to discern and highlight subtle nuances within the video, such as noise.
- **Behavioral Analysis:**
  - Our AI conducts intricate analyses, detecting anomalies like missing individuals in the video and identifying scenarios with two or more persons sharing the same frame.
- **Visual Quality Assessment:**
  - By assessing factors like open/closed eyes and video blurring, our system ensures a comprehensive evaluation of the video's visual quality, alerting to potential issues or manipulations.
- **Metadata Validation:**
  - Going beyond the visual realm, our AI extends its capabilities to scrutinize metadata, identifying irregularities that may signal attempts to manipulate or deceive.

#### Business Logic
- **Java for Multithreading and Concurrency:**
  - Java's robust support for multithreading and concurrency allows our application to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, leveraging the power of parallelism to significantly enhance performance.
- **Thread-Safe Data Structures in Java:**
  - The use of Java's thread-safe Data Structures ensures that our application maintains data integrity, crucial for reliable and concurrent data handling within the system.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
  - Java's "write once, run anywhere" philosophy enables our application to run seamlessly on different platforms, ensuring a consistent user experience regardless of the operating system.
- **Spring Boot for Web Application:**
  - Spring Boot, coupled with Java, facilitates the development of our web application. The integration with Maven streamlines configuration, and the use of Spring Boot's conventions reduces boilerplate code, promoting code reuse.
- **Solid Principles for Clean Code:**
  - Adhering to SOLID principles results in clean, maintainable code. This approach enhances the scalability of our application and promotes ease of understanding for developers working on the project.
- **Efficient Deployment with Demo:**
  - Our deployment strategy includes a BAT file, a JAR file, and a custom PythonRunner module. This combination allows for an efficient and hassle-free execution of Python scripts without the need for Python installation on the client's machine.
- **Robust App Architecture:**
  - Lombok simplifies code by reducing boilerplate, while the use of interfaces for controllers and services enhances the robustness of our application architecture, supporting scalability and ease of maintenance.
- **Web App Interface with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap:**
  - The graphical user interface (GUI) of our web app is designed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive user experience. Thymeleaf facilitates seamless integration with the backend, enabling dynamic data presentation and file uploads.
- **Synchronization and Asynchronous Handling:**
  - Synchronous methods are employed to monitor changes in asynchronous operations. The Future<?> class is utilized to manage asynchronous tasks, ensuring efficient handling of dynamic data and responsiveness.
- **Dynamic Parameter Passing:**
  - Our system's ability to dynamically pass parameters to Python scripts adds a layer of flexibility, allowing the application to adapt to different scenarios and user requirements.
- **Configuration Simplicity and README:**
  - The configuration process for our application is designed to be straightforward. The README provides users with comprehensive, step-by-step instructions on configuring the app and utilizing its various features. This user-friendly approach ensures a smooth onboarding experience for users.

### Future Plans
In our future plans, we aspire to elevate performance significantly by developing a Python compiler, introducing an exciting challenge to further enhance the capabilities of our system.
